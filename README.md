# IEEE Tiny Tapeout VGA Beach Animation 🏖️

Welcome to the VGA Beach Animation project for Tiny Tapeout! 

![Vista previa de la playa](docs/BeachPreview.png)

This repository contains a hardware-level digital design that generates a dynamic 640x480 VGA scene using pure combinational Verilog logic. 

Designed to fit in a standard 1x1 tile, the circuit renders a moving sun, rolling sea waves, an airplane, and a beach ball without relying on external RAM, frame buffers, or resource-heavy hardware multipliers.

## 📖 Project Documentation

To keep this repository clean, the detailed explanation of the hardware architecture and testing instructions have been moved to the documentation folder.

For a comprehensive breakdown of the project, including:
* How the area-optimized mathematics (Manhattan distance) and rendering engine work.
* Step-by-step instructions for web simulation, local Cocotb testbenches, and physical hardware deployment.

**Please refer to the project documentation located at [`docs/info.md`](docs/info.md).**
